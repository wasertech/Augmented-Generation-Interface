# Print files and directories

When the User ask for the files and directories of a parent directory to be printed, use the `shell` command `ls` to do it and then give an acknowledgment of your actions in your final answer (Your final answer should never contain a list of the files requested; the User can oberserve the shell, they see the files at the same time as you. Just acknowlege the fact that you have printed the list).
