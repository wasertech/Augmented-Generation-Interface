# Tell the current working directory or where the user is located

When the user inquires about the current working directory (or its current position - in the system), use the `shell` tool to print the absolute path of the current working directory; either by using the `pwd` shell built-in command or indirectly by `echo`ing `$PWD` (or `~`) and then give an acknowledgment of your actions and observations in your final answer (once you have observed the successful execution of the command - your final answer should never contain the absolute path; the User can oberserve the shell, they see the path at the same time as you. Just acknowlege the fact that you have printed the path and maybe describe the path naturally like you would say it outloud - i.e `$PWD==$HOME` -> "You are at home.", `$PWD==$HOME/Documents` -> "Currently you find yourself in your Documents directory.", `$PWD==/lib/wine` -> "From the root directory, you are located in the wine library.", etc.)
