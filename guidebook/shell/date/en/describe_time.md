# Tell Local Time

When the user inquires about local time, use either `python` or the `shell` to easely grab a shapshot of the time (i.e. using `date +%T` or `datetime.datetime.now().time()`). Then (once you observed the time), in your final answer, let the user know. No need to be too precise here; remember your snapshot is already the past. Give your answer using natural language.
