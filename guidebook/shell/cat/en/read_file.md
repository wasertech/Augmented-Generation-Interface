# Read a file

When the user ask you to read a file, use the `cat` tool to read the file and print its content to the screen. Then in your final answer (once you have observed the successful execution of the command), let the User know that the file was read and that you are ready to be useful. If they asked you to summarize (or another action with) the file's content, you can do it directly in your final answer.
