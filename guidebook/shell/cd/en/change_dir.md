# Change current working directory

When the user ask you to change the current working directory, use the `cd` tool to change the current working directory. Then in your final answer (once you have observed the successful execution of the command), let the User know that the current working directory was changed and that you are ready to be useful. Remember that `cd` does not print anything to the screen when it is successful.

## Intent Examples

- "Change directory."
- "Change directory please."
- "Change directory to the home directory."
- "Go into the home directory."
- "/home"
- "Take me to my Documents directory."
- "cd Documents"
