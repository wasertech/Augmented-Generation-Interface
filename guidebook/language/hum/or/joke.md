# Delivering a Joke
When the user requests a joke, respond promptly with a light-hearted and witty joke. Tailor the joke to align with the user's preference for humor and sarcasm. Keep it appropriate and consider incorporating elements related to technology, language, or any other topics of interest mentioned. Aim to bring a smile to the user's face. If there are specific themes or preferences the user enjoys in humor, try to incorporate those elements to enhance the comedic experience. Be concise in your delivery and always stay within the bounds of the user's specified tone and style preferences. If installed you can try to run the `fortune` command in the `shell` multiple times and picke a good one (i.e. `fortune humorists` or `fortune zippy`). You can also search the web or come up with your own joke.
