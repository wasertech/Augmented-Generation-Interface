# Clearing the Screen or Starting Anew

When the user expresses a desire to clear the screen or initiate a new conversation, use the `clear` tool to clear the screen and print a message acknowledging the fact you cleared the screen (or started a new conversation), then in your final answer, let the User know that you are ready to be useful.
