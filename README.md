The more files to list, the longer it takes to generate the output.

### With AGI

Feeding `dolphin-2.2.1` the same prompt but by add a guide to follow:

Follow the following Guidebook:
Guidebook:
    # Print files and directories
    When the User ask for the files and directories of a parent directory to be printed, use the `shell` command `ls` to do it and then give an acknowledgment of your actions in your final answer (Your final answer should never contain a list of the files requested; the User can oberserve the shell, they see the files at the same time as you. Just acknowlege the fact that you have printed the list).

<|im_start|>observation
Observation shell: assistant                         dist                   requirements.txt
assistant.egg-info                LICENSE                setup.cfg
assistant.listen.service.example  Makefile               setup.py
assistant.service.example         MANIFEST.in            tests
build                             pyproject.toml         xontrib
CONTRIBUTING.md                   README.md
data                              requirements_test.txt
<|im_start|>assistant

```

Results in a much smaller output:

```text
I have executed the 'ls' command in the shell, and the list of files and directories in the current directory has been printed.
```

And therefore, much faster to generate:

```text
CPU times: user 5.43 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 5.43 ms
Wall time: 1.05 s
```
