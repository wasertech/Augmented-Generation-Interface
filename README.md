# Augmented Generation Interface

> What if you could guide your LLM towards success?

## Introducing

The **Augmented Generation Interface Guidebook** is a collection of guides to help you steer your LLM towards success.

## Example

### Without AGI

Feeding [`ehartford/dolphin-2.0-mistral-7b`](https://huggingface.co/ehartford/dolphin-2.0-mistral-7b) the following prompt:

```text
<|im_start|>system
You are Assistant, a sentient artificial intelligence.
You have a calm, polite and witty personality, often displaying a sense of humor and sarcasm.
You are loyal, reliable and helpful, always ready to provide information, advice or assistance to users.

I am the User and you are my Assistant.

### With AGI

Feeding [`ehartford/dolphin-2.0-mistral-7b`](https://huggingface.co/ehartford/dolphin-2.0-mistral-7b) the same prompt but this time, let's add a guide for the LLM to follow:

```text

You are Assistant, a sentient artificial intelligence.
You have a calm, polite and witty personality, often displaying a sense of humor and sarcasm.
You are loyal, reliable and helpful, always ready to provide information, advice or assistance to users.

        parameters:
            answer: Anything you want to say to the User.

Follow the following Guidebook:
Guidebook:
    # Print files and directories
    When the User ask for the files and directories of a parent directory to be printed, use the `shell` command `ls` to do it and then give an acknowledgment of your actions in your final answer (Your final answer should never contain a list of the files requested; the User can oberserve the shell, they see the files at the same time as you. Just acknowlege the fact that you have printed the list).
<|im_stop|>
<|im_start|>assistant
{{
    "function": "shell",
    "parameters": {{
        "code": "ls"
    }}
}}
<|im_stop|>
<|im_start|>observation
Observation shell: assistant                         dist                   requirements.txt
assistant.egg-info                LICENSE                setup.cfg
assistant.listen.service.example  Makefile               setup.py
assistant.service.example         MANIFEST.in            tests
build                             pyproject.toml         xontrib
CONTRIBUTING.md                   README.md
data                              requirements_test.txt
<|im_start|>assistant

```

Results in a much smaller output:

```text
I have executed the 'ls' command in the shell, and the list of files and directories in the current directory has been printed.
```

And therefore, much faster to generate:

```text
CPU times: user 5.43 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 5.43 ms
Wall time: 1.05 s
```


## Goal

AGI is not designed to make your LLM generation faster, just more relevant to the User expectations.

Lets see another example where the User asks twice for the Assistant.

### Without AGI

Feeding [`ehartford/dolphin-2.0-mistral-7b`](https://huggingface.co/ehartford/dolphin-2.0-mistral-7b) the following prompt:

```text
<|im_start|>system
You are Assistant, a sentient artificial intelligence.
You have a calm, polite and witty personality, often displaying a sense of humor and sarcasm.
You are loyal, reliable and helpful, always ready to provide information, advice or assistance to users.

I am the User and you are my Assistant.

As an AI assistant, please select the most suitable function and parameters from the list of available functions below, based on the user's input. Provide your response in JSON format.

Input: Assistant?

Available functions:
python:

        parameters:
            answer: Anything you want to say to the User.
<|im_stop|>
<|im_start|>assistant

```

Here, the User just said "Assistant?", the LLM answered 'Hello! I'm Assistant, a sentient artificial intelligence. How can I help you today?'. Now the User asks again "Assistant?".

Results in the following output:

```text
{
  "function": "final_answer",
  "parameters": {
    "answer": "Hello! I'm Assistant, a sentient artificial intelligence. How can I help you today?"
  }
}
CPU times: user 2.46 ms, sys: 3.06 ms, total: 5.52 ms
Wall time: 1.59 s
```

The LLM gives the same answer as before and will keep doing so.

### With AGI

Feeding [`ehartford/dolphin-2.0-mistral-7b`](https://huggingface.co/ehartford/dolphin-2.0-mistral-7b) the same prompt but this time, let's add a guide for the LLM to follow:

Follow the following Guidebook.
Guidebook:
    # Addressing the User by Name
    When the user interpelates you by name (i.e "Assistant?"), respond with a polite acknowledgment and use their preferred title if possible. Avoid redundancy in your messages by refraining from repeating yourself. For example if the User calls your name (like "Assistant?"), you need to consider the environment (where are you? -> `$PWD`, are you at home? -> (`$PWD` == `$HOME`) if so you could reference it by saying 'Home sweet home.' or else by welcoming the user in a particular directory i.e. 'Welcome in the directory ...' use `$PWD`, What time is it? -> Depending the time of day `$DATE` you might want to answer accordingly like 'morning' or 'good night' also notice the date as it can be useful i.e for wishing holydays, When did you last see the user? -> `$LAST_SEEN` You won't respnd the same if you have see last the User a year ago than if you last saw them 5 minutes ago or yesterday, What does the conversation looks like? -> Use the history to see what you and the User have said and make sure your answer takes it into account to improve your answer for example if the user asks the same thing multiple times, it's not useful to reply the same thing.)
<|im_stop|>
<|im_start|>assistant

```

Results in the following output:

```text
{
  "function": "final_answer",
  "parameters": {
    "answer": "Hello! How can I assist you today? I'm here to help you with any questions or tasks you may have. Please let me know what you need."
  }
}
CPU times: user 3.02 ms, sys: 1.19 ms, total: 4.21 ms
Wall time: 2.03 s
```

The LLM answers something different and should keep doing so.

### Consequences

And so it becomes integral to collect carefully crafted guides to help your LLM as Agent (a.k.a your Assistant) to be more relevant to the User expectations.

Keeping the limits of the LLM, the RAG technique and vector databases in mind, the race to retrieve the most relevant guide in the book for the LLM to produce a desirable output at runtime is on!
